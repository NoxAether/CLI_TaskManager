# CLI Task Manager (BASH ONLY)

This shit is half broken and a lot can be removed.

I think i will fix some things, clean it all up and expand on customisability.

User setup scripts will be added to ask for custom colors and of course its bash so they can edit the theme.bash file.

Use the `install.sh` to set everything up.

Use the ~/.bashTaskman/`remove.sh` to remove everything that was setup.

You can remove the cloned repo after running `install.sh`
